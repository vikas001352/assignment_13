    "Consistency: Inheriting from the Exception class ensures that your custom exception follows the same design and behavior as other built-in exceptions. This consistency makes it easier for developers to understand and use your custom exception in a similar manner as they would use the standard exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Catching All Exceptions: By inheriting from the Exception class, your custom exception becomes a subclass of the general Exception class. This allows you to catch your custom exception using a broader except block that catches all exceptions, such as except Exception:. This is helpful when you want to handle multiple exceptions, including your custom exception, in a single block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interoperability: Using the Exception class as the base class ensures that your custom exception can be used in various contexts and integrated seamlessly with existing exception handling mechanisms. It allows your custom exception to be caught, raised, or handled alongside other exceptions in a consistent manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future Compatibility: Python's built-in exceptions are part of the language's standard library and are well-maintained and backward-compatible. By inheriting from the Exception class, your custom exception will automatically benefit from any improvements, updates, or new features introduced to the base class in future Python releases.\n",

    "Use multiple except blocks: If you need to handle multiple exceptions, use separate except blocks for each exception type. This helps you to handle each exception individually and apply appropriate error handling logic.\n",

    "Handle exceptions at the appropriate level: Handle exceptions at a level in your code where you can effectively handle or recover from them. This helps to maintain the separation of concerns and makes the code more modular and maintainable.\n",

    "Provide meaningful error messages: Include informative error messages when raising exceptions or printing error output. Clear and descriptive error messages help with debugging and make it easier to understand the cause of the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log exceptions: Consider using a logging framework to log exceptions. Logging exceptions with proper context can assist in troubleshooting and monitoring application issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use try-except-else blocks: Utilize the else block in try-except statements to execute code that should run if no exceptions occur. This helps to separate the main logic from exception handling logic and improves code readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid silent failures: Avoid catching exceptions without any action or printing error messages. If an exception occurs, ensure it is appropriately handled or at least logged, so that issues are not silently ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test exception handling: Write test cases to verify that exceptions are raised and handled correctly. This helps to ensure that your exception handling code functions as expected and improves the reliability of your program.\n",
    "\n",
